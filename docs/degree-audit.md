## Degree Audit Reporting System
A Degree Audit Report provides a detailed report of a student's progress towards their degree. The Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) helps students track their progress toward completing their degree. This feature allows users to track their progress by describing the classes they have taken, their GPAs and classes they need to take to get their degree. The system will generate a personalized audit based on your major and academic records, giving you an overview of your progress toward graduation.

### Running Your DARS Audit
Under the "Hokie SPA" tab, select "DARS and Hokie GPS - Graduation Plan for Success." This will bring you to a new page where you can access your degree audit.

Next, click "Run Declared Programs." The number of audits DARS produces depends on how many majors you have. If you have a minor, that aspect of your degree will be included in one of these audits.

### Understanding Your DARS Report
Your audit consists of two main sections:

1. A visual graph that summarizes your academic progress.
2. A checklist that details your remaining graduation requirements.

#### Visual Graph

*Graphical breakdown of your audit including Credit Hours, GPA, and more.*

The visual graph at the top of your audit provides a quick snapshot of your progress:

* Green sections indicate completed courses.
* Blue sections represent courses currently in progress.
* Red sections highlight courses you still need to complete before graduation.

In addition to your progress, this section displays your major GPA and overall university GPA, giving you an idea of where you stand academically.

#### Checklist Section

![checklistdars](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1yoMgm61e.png)

*Checklist showing completed, incomplete, and in progress requirements.*

The checklist provides a more detailed breakdown of your degree requirements, helping you track what you've completed and what still needs to be done:

* Green checkmark: Completed requirements. No further action required.
* Blue box with "...": Courses in progress. These will be marked as complete once you successfully finish the semester.
* Red box with an "X": Incomplete requirements. These need to be fulfilled before graduation.

Clicking on a red box reveals additional details, such as:

* Courses you've already taken that partially fulfill the requirement.
* The number of credits still needed.
* Suggested courses to complete the requirement, making registration easier.

### Request a What-If Audit
If you are considering changing majors, adding a minor, or simply exploring other academic options, DARS allows you to generate a "What-If" audit. This tool lets you see how your completed courses would count toward a different programâ€™s requirements. 

To do this:

1. Click "Audits" in the maroon banner.
2. Select "Request New."

This tool proves especially useful if you're considering a double major or switching fields. The "What If" tool allows you to compare different paths and determine the best course of action for your academic journey.
