## Checksheets

Checksheets allow you to determine what courses you need to take to complete your degree. The Checksheets page provides a cohesive list of the classes that are to be taken in each semester to get your degree.

Visit the Registrar's [Checksheets page](https://www.registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/checksheets.html) to access the different checksheets available in Virginia Tech.

### Finding the right checksheet

Every major and minor has a dedicated checksheet. To use checksheets effectively, you need to find the checksheet containing information about your specific major or minor.
