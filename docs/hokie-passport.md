## Hokie Passport Services
Hokie Passport Services provides a convenient way for students to manage their campus-related expenses. With this service, you can:

* Add money to your Hokie Passport account.
* Add money to your Dining Dollars account.
* Check balances for both accounts and review past transactions.

Before using Hokie Passport Services, make sure you understand the difference between Hokie Passport funds and Dining Dollars:

* **Dining Dollars** can only be used for on-campus dining locations. However, when you pay with Dining Dollars, you receive a [percentage discount](https://dining.vt.edu/content/dining_vt_edu/en/about/Dining_Services_at_a_Glance/_jcr_content/content/vtmulticolumn_1257757695/vt-items_2/vtcontainer_copy/vtcontainer-content/vtmultitab_1600716354/vt-items_0/download_1239597512/file.res/Dining%20Plans%202022.pdf) on food purchases based on which meal plan you have. Discounts on meals can range anywhere from 5% to 50% depending on your plan.
* **Hokie Passport** funds are more versatile and can be used for various campus services, including vending machines, laundry facilities, dining locations (at full price), library printing, and select off-campus restaurants that accept Hokie Passport payments.

Having both accounts helps you balance convenience and savings while managing your campus expenses efficiently.

### Where You Can Use Your Funds
Understanding where and how you can use your funds helps maximize their benefits:

* Dining Dollars: Accepted at all on-campus dining locations. Using Dining Dollars provides a built-in discount on food purchases, making them the best option for campus dining.
* Hokie Passport: Can be used for a wider range of purchases, including:
    * On-campus vending machines.
    * Laundry machines in residence halls.
    * Campus dining locations, though without the discount that Dining Dollars provide.
    * Library printing services.
    * Select off-campus restaurants that accept Hokie Passport payments.

If you frequently eat on campus, Dining Dollars offer better value due to the discount. However, Hokie Passport funds provide more flexibility for non-dining expenses.
