The image above reflects what you should see once you click on the aforementioned link. We will look at the most important links below.

### Timetable of Classes
Timetable offers incredibly powerful features. Despite the outdated Graphical User Interface (GUI), the timetable of classes will show you:

* All available class sections for a specific class during a semester
* Class requirements and prerequisites
* Location, meeting times, exam times, credit hours
  
You can search the above by Term, Pathways, Subject, Course Number, Course Request Number (CRN), and Course Modality.

*Figure 16: Screenshot of timetable menu.*

* Campus: Select the campus location of the class 
* Subject: Choose from all subjects offered at that campus 
* Modality: Select whether the class meets online, in person, or in a hybrid format
* Term: Select the term of the class you are looking for
* CRN: If you already have the CRN for a course, input the CRN into the respective box

After making your selections, you will see a vast list of courses with all the information mentioned above. You can use the information from this report to select courses for the semester.

### Course Request

Course request serves as a another very powerful tool in the VT database. Use Course Request prior to the opening of Add/Drop to place into courses. The process is fairly simple, just add the CRNs of each class (can be found in timetable), and click "Add CRNs".

Once you are done adding courses, click the "submit" button to send over your course request to the Registrarâ€™s Office. 

### Registration (Add/Drop)

Registration (Add/Drop) allows you to add or drop classes once the Course Request period as ended.

* Prepare for Registration: This section shows any holds on your account and outlines the steps needed to resolve them, along with tasks to complete before you can register for classes.
* Browse Classes: Less detailed version of Timetable, where you can only see one course at a time and must have the CRN beforehand.
* Browse Course Catalog: Same as the function "Browse Classes", but provides more details about a specific course.
* Add/Drop-Register for Classes: The bread and butter of your college career. Here you can see all the courses you are registered for. More importantly, the Add/Drop feature will allow you to add and drop courses as you see fit.
