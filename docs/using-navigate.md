## Using Navigate 

Navigate allows you to schedule a meeting with your academic advisor. Academic advisors assist students with their time in college and provide them with the most efficient ways to complete their degree. HokieSPA provides a link to Navigate on the home page.

### How to schedule an appointment with your advisor

Upon clicking the link to Navigate on HokieSPA (the 6th link from the top), you should see your account on Navigate. On the left side panel, click on the tab labeled "Appointments". Your screen should look like the image below:

After attending your meeting, your advisor will likely give you notes and resources. You can find these resources on Navigate. To view them, click on the "My Docs" tab on the left panel.
