By: Hannah Baum, Nandita Prasanth, Aditya Singh Student Guide to HokieSPA HokieSPA contains important information relevant to students enrolled in Virginia Tech. It allows you to access your courses, view your grades and plan your semesters. However, HokieSPA is not easy to navigate. It contains a lot of information organized in an unnecessarily complicated manner. Our user guide aims to rectify this problem by providing a detailed but concise guide to the intricacies of HokieSPA. Table of Contents Using Navigate Degree Audit Reporting System Course Registration Hokie Passport Services Student Organizations Conclusion Using Navigate Navigate allows you to schedule a meeting with your academic advisor by using a site called Navigate. Academic advisors assist students with their time in college and provide them with the most efficient ways to complete their degree. HokieSPA provides a link to Navigate on its home page. How to schedule an appointment with your advisor Upon clicking the link to Navigate on HokieSPA (the 6th link from the top), you should see your account on Navigate. On the left side panel, click on the tab labeled \"Appointments\". Your screen should look like this: Click on the \"Schedule an Appointment\" button and schedule the date and time of your appointment. After attending your meeting, your advisor will likely give you notes and resources. You can find these resources on Navigate. To view them, click on the \"My Docs\" tab on the left panel. On this page, you can find your appointment summaries by clicking the button. Degree Audit Reporting System The Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) is a system that allows students to understand their progress towards their degree. It allows users to track their progress by describing the classes they have taken, their GPAs and classes they need to take to get their degree. Running Your DARS Audit Under the \"Hokie SPA\" tab, select \"DARS and Hokie GPS - Graduation Plan for Success.\" This will bring you to a new page where you can access your degree audit. Once there, click the maroon \"Run Audit\" button. The system will generate a personalized audit based on your major and academic records, giving you an overview of your progress toward graduation. Next, click \"Run Declared Programs.\" The number of audits DARS produces depends on how many majors you have. If you have a minor, it will be included in one of these audits. Click the \"View Audit\" hyperlink to open your report and see a breakdown of your academic progress Understanding Your DARS Report Your audit consists of two main sections: A visual graph that summarizes your academic progress. A checklist that details your remaining graduation requirements. Visual Graph The visual graph at the top of your audit provides a quick snapshot of your progress: Green sections indicate completed courses. Blue sections represent courses currently in progress. Red sections highlight courses you still need to complete before graduation. In addition to your progress, this section displays your major GPA and overall university GPA, giving you an idea of where you stand academically. Checklist Section The checklist is a more detailed breakdown of your degree requirements, helping you track what you've completed and what still needs to be done: Green checkmark: Completed requirements. No further action is needed. Blue box with \"...\": Courses in progress. These will be marked as complete once you successfully finish the semester. Red box with an \"X\": Incomplete requirements. These need to be fulfilled before graduation. Clicking on a red box reveals additional details, such as: * Courses you've already taken that partially fulfill the requirement. * The number of credits still needed. * Suggested courses to complete the requirement, making registration easier. Request an Audit If you are considering changing majors, adding a minor, or simply exploring other academic options, DARS allows you to generate a \"What-If\" audit. This tool lets you see how your completed courses would count toward a different program\u2019s requirements. To do this: 1. Click \"Audits\" in the maroon banner. 2. Select \"Request New.\" Click \"Select a Different Audit\" and enter the program and catalog year (the year and semester you started at Virginia Tech). To test a minor, select your current major first; a minor selection box will then appear. Hit \"Run Different Program\" and then select the \"what if\" audit in the updated list of audits. This tool is especially useful if you're considering a double major or switching fields. It allows you to compare different paths and determine the best course of action for your academic journey.

You can also view your schedule as a whole. The link titled \"Course Registration and Schedule Menu\" will get you to this menu. The image above is what you should see once you click on the a formentioned link. We will look at the most important links below. Timetable of Classes Timetable is an incredibly powerful tool.
